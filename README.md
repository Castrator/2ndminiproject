# 2nd Mini Project
 
## Problem 1. UCI Human Activity Recognition
#### a. Create an R script called run_analysis.R. The script should include the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#### b. Create a `README.md` which explains how all the scripts work and how they are connected. This should include the step-by-step procedures that you did in any transformations or how you performed to clean up the data until having a tidy data. 

## Problem 2. Household Power Consumption
#### a. Loading the data
When loading the dataset into R, consider the following:
* The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).
* We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.
* You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the `strptime()` and `as.Date()` functions.
* Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as `?`.
#### b. Making Plots
Your task is to construct the following plots below using the dataset:
* Construct the 4 plots in just one R file called `plots.R`. Write some comments in your R script to separate each part of the script for each plot. Your code should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. Include also the code that creates the PNG file. **Note that the course pack provided to you in any form is intended only for 
your use in connection with the course that you are enrolled in. It is not for distribution or sale. Permission should be obtained from your instructor for any use other than for what is intended.**
Name each of the generated plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot3.png`, and `plot4.png`.
